# Tap my emotions

## A fun game to learn more about emotions!

### Introduction

**Tap my emotions** is an application designed for children on the Autism Spectrum 
to better understand and recognize their own and other's emotions through the game 
*"How would they feel?"*.

A simple run of the application is:

- Users choose if they want to be a **player** or **designer**.
- **Players**: Each time, a scenario will be presented (e.g. A friend broke your 
favourite toy, how would you feel?), and players will then type in what emotions they will experience 
in that scenario. They will be given feedback of their total score.
- **Designers**: Designers add new scenarios to the game. They will first write 
out the scenario, and write down the correct answer.

Target audience:
- Children facing difficulties in identifying emotions will be the **players** 
of the application. 
- Teachers or parents will act as the **designers** and can modify or add new 
scenarios to the existing game.

Why?

My experience working as a therapist for elementary school children on the Autism Spectrum 
sparked my interest in this project. Many of my students found it challenging to express 
themselves emotionally because they do not understand the variety of emotions one can feel.
